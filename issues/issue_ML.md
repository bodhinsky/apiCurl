Title: Integrate Machine Learning

Issue Description:
Integrate machine learning capabilities into the codebase to enable predictive analysis and recommendations based on the user's music collection data.

Issue Requirements:
Preprocess and prepare the dataset for machine learning. Explore and implement relevant machine learning algorithms. Train models for artist recommendation and release prediction. Evaluate model performance and optimize hyperparameters. Integrate trained models into the application logic.
Update UI to display recommendations and predictions. Ensure data privacy and security for machine learning workflows. Implement model retraining and updating mechanisms. Optimize performance for machine learning inference and predictions.
