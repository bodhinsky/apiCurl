Title: Implement Data Filtering with Pandas

Description:

As of now, the codebase contains authentication and music data collection. The music data should now be stored in a pandas dataframe, allowing filtering and aggregation based on attributes like artist, album, genre, and release year. Ensure proper authentication, data protection, scalability, and maintainability. Provide an intuitive user interface for collection management. 

Requirements:

Store music collection data in pandas dataframe with attributes like artist, album, genre, release year. Implement data filtering and aggregation based on music attributes. Optimize for scalability and performance with large collections.
Follow best practices for maintainability, testing, and documentation.
Seamlessly integrate with existing codebase.
