The data about the releases does not match some releases. Either the artist name has numbers due to ambiguous names or small mistakes in the naming. For example when calling the validateRelease, it returns "A Beautiful Lie by 30 Seconds To Mars seems to be missing on Spotify" even though the record does exist on Spotify. Same goes for "Islands by Bear's Den seems to be missing on Spotify", which is there, but no obvious reason for the miss is present. Check either processing of the data, or the validation with the Spotify API.
